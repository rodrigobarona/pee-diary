# Eleva Diary

## UI & Visual Design Brief

**Design reference:** ICON_05
**Design goal:** Calm authority, privacy, flow, care

---

## 1. Product Philosophy (non-negotiable)

Eleva Diary is **not** a medical dashboard.
It is a **private health companion**.

The app should feel:

- **Personal, quiet, and respectful**
- More like **Apple Health or Journal**
- Less like a “tracker”, “log”, or “clinical tool”

Design principle:

> “Reduce friction. Reduce judgment. Increase awareness.”

Users should feel **safe opening the app anywhere**, at any time.

---

## 2. Core Visual Concept (based on ICON_05)

### ICON_05 meaning

ICON_05 represents:

- Flow over fluid
- Rhythm over event
- Pattern over problem

This abstraction must guide the entire UI.

### Translation into UI

- No harsh lines
- No aggressive charts
- No “warning red” dashboards
- No gamification pressure

Everything should feel:

- continuous
- measured
- human

---

## 3. Brand Color System

### Color philosophy

Colors must:

- lower anxiety
- signal trust
- avoid medical urgency
- remain accessible in long sessions

No saturated primaries.
No hospital blues.
No alert-driven UI.

## 4. Typography (Google Fonts)

- modern
- system-adjacent
- invisible when working well

### Recommended Font Pairing

---

### Typography Rules

- No all-caps

---

## 5. Layout & Structure Principles

### Spacing over lines

- Use white space to separate meaning
- Avoid heavy dividers
- Cards should feel like resting surfaces

### Corners

```
Radius: 8–12px
```

Soft, not bubbly.

### Shadows

- Extremely subtle
- One elevation level only
- Never “material” heavy shadows

---

## 6. Interaction & Motion

### Motion philosophy

Motion should:

- explain
- reassure
- never surprise

Examples:

- Gentle fades
- Soft vertical transitions
- No bouncing
- No spring exaggeration

### Haptic feedback

- Light
- Confirmational
- Never alarming

---

## 7. Data Visualization Style

Charts should:

- show patterns, not performance
- avoid sharp spikes
- avoid red/green contrasts

Preferred:

- Line charts with rounded joins
- Soft bar charts
- Time-based groupings

Never:

- Leaderboards
- Scores
- Aggressive streak pressure

---

## 8. Language & Tone (UI Copy)

Tone:

- Neutral
- Supportive
- Non-judgmental

Bad:

> “You missed your goal”

Good:

> “Here’s how today looks so far”

---

## 9. Accessibility (must-have)

- Color contrast WCAG AA minimum
- Large tap targets
- Clear focus states
- Dark mode fully supported (not inverted)

Dark mode should feel:

- calm
- deep teal-based
- never pure black

---

## 10. Reference Apps (design alignment)

Designers should look at:

- Apple Health
- Apple Journal
- Apple Sleep
- Apple Mindfulness
- Calm (UI restraint, not branding)
- Day One (structure)

Avoid references to:

- Fitness gamification apps
- Hospital systems
- Enterprise dashboards

---

## 11. Final Design North Star

If the designer is unsure, ask:

> “Would this feel comfortable to open in public?”
> “Does this reduce anxiety or add pressure?”
> “Does this feel like understanding, not measuring?”

If the answer isn’t **yes**, simplify.
